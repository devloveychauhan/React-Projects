Welcome — this repository is a curated collection of small-to-medium React projects I build to learn, experiment and demonstrate practical frontend skills (hooks, routing, state management, testing, animations, accessibility and modern build tooling).

This README is intended to act as a profile-style introduction for the repository. Update project details and badges below as you add new apps.

## About this repo
This repository contains independent React projects (each in its own folder). Each project demonstrates a focused concept or feature set — for example:
- Building responsive UIs with CSS-in-JS / CSS Modules / Tailwind
- Managing state using Context API, Redux Toolkit or Zustand
- Client-side routing with React Router
- Data fetching, caching and optimistic updates
- Component patterns, forms, input validation and accessibility practices
- Unit and integration tests with Jest and React Testing Library

Use these projects for learning, demoing features, or as small starting points to expand into larger apps.

## Highlights / Example projects
(Replace these placeholders with the actual project names and short descriptions from the repo)
- Todo App — a minimal, accessible todo list using hooks and localStorage persistence
- Weather Dashboard — fetches weather data from an API with caching and error handling
- Calculator — a responsive calculator with keyboard support and unit tests
- E-commerce UI — product listing, cart flow (front-end only), responsive layout
- Chat UI — realtime-style interface mock (WebSocket demo can be added)

If you want me to generate or update this list with the exact folders and descriptions found in this repo, tell me and I’ll scan the repository and add them automatically.

   - git clone https://github.com/devloveychauhan/React-Projects.git
2. Enter the project folder you want to run, for example:
   - cd React-Projects/<project-folder>
3. Install dependencies
   - npm install
   (or `yarn` / `pnpm` depending on the project)
4. Start the dev server
   - npm start
5. Open http://localhost:3000 (or the port shown in the console)

Each project folder contains its own README with project-specific instructions (dependencies, environment vars, API keys).

---

## Available scripts
Common scripts you will find in individual project folders:
- npm start — run development server
- npm run build — create production build
- npm test — run test suite
- npm run lint — run ESLint
- npm run format — run Prettier

Always check the project-level package.json for exact scripts and tooling.

## Contribution guidelines
Thanks for wanting to contribute! A few simple rules:
1. Open an issue to discuss large changes before submitting a PR.
2. Fork the repo, create a topic branch, make changes, and submit a PR with a clear description.
3. Keep commits focused and amend the PR description with any testing steps.
4. Add or update project-level README when changing run instructions or dependencies.

If you want me to add a CONTRIBUTING.md and a template PR/issue for this repo, say the word and I’ll create them.

## License
Specify a license per project or a repository-level license. If you want an MIT license added, I can create a LICENSE file.

---

## Tips to personalize this README
- Replace the example project list with actual folders and a one-line description per project.
- Add demo GIFs or screenshots under each project section to show behavior.
- Add live demo links (Vercel/Netlify) for each finished project.
- Add a GitHub Actions badge once CI is present.

---

Thanks for creating this repository — if you'd like, I can:
- Scan the repo and replace the placeholder project list with the real directories and short summaries.
- Add a LICENSE or CONTRIBUTING file.
- Create GitHub Actions CI templates for lint/test/build.

Tell me which of those you'd like me to do next.
